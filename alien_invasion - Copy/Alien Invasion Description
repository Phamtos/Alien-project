In the project, Alien Invasion, we are creating a simple game
that shows that basic level of game development using the 
Python package, pygame.
The player is able to control a ship that first appears at 
the bottom center of the screen. The player is able to move
the ship left or right using the arrow keys and shoot bullets
using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens
fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player
shoots and destroy the aliens as they move down the screen. If
the player is successful is clearing the screen of the aliens,
a new fleet of aliens appears that are faster than the previous
fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom
of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three
ships, the game ends.
